# Teen-Alcohol-Project
We investigate factors associated with alcohol use in teenagers. A multilevel model is used to model 246
observations by 82 different teenagers. We find the alcohol consumption is highest for male teenagers with
alcoholic parent, and is higher for teenagers with friends who also drink . We also find that alcohol consumption
tends to increase with age (from 14 to 16). Finally, we find that there is more variability in alcohol consumption
over the years by the same teenager than between different teenagers at age 14
